## About

#### I am Arvind Adiga

I have been involved in the Software Engineering field for over 4 years now. During this journey, I have
had the opportunity to work on several interesting projects. These projects vary in their domains, such as Web-development, Software testing,
Server Management and Networking. However, I have had my eyes set on the **Full-stack** development field,
because it gives me a chance to learn & stay updated with several Technologies, and also broadens my perspective.

Being in this area has led me to work for various clients, meet new people and to be a part of various teams.
Apart from development, I am also experienced in writing documentation and in using source code analysis tools, which has greatly helped in the 
maintainability of the projects. I like to challenge myself by learning new technologies and build side projects during my free
time.

Besides technology, I have a passion for Art, Football, Music, playing the Guitar,
gaming, food and travel! If you share similar interests, get in touch with me at [adiga1993@gmail.com](mailto:adiga1993@gmail.com).
